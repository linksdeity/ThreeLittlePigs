There was only silence and blackness. From my own abyss; an ocean of darkness, arose two golden discs beyond the window pane. Like two searchlights they landed upon me. Their malevolence was not betrayed when a howl like a thousand banshees sliced my mind into pieces. And then came the winds.
The walls began to shake. From the heart of the maelstrom the beast with its bottomless appetite took in great mouthfulls of silent air, and produced a weaponized cone of destruction which began to eat away at my home and my sanity. I screamed but it was silence against the thunder, and all fell away - leaving the empty night as my only abode.
